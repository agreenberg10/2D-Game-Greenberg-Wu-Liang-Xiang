Little Girl: Thank you for letting me stay...
- Of course.
- (Stay Silent)
[i] Silence falls betweeen you two. [/i]
[i] The child from before runs past again, a blur, followed by the Conductor. [/i]
[i] The Conductor stops to catch his breath. [/i]
The Conductor: Oh, I forgot about you.
[i] He notices the little girl sitting across from you. [/i]
The Conductor: Oh, you're here too. Good.
[i] He turns back to you. [/i]
The Conductor: Did you manage to figure out your ticket situation?
- No sir, I'm sorry.
- I completely forgot- See. there was this weird guy-
The Conductor: So no tickets?
- No sir.
The Conductor: And do you expect me to keep you on this train with no ticket?
- No, sir... I'll leave.
	The Conductor: Good idea.
	=> END
- I don't need a stupid ticket.
	The Conductor: Get off the train.
	=> END
- I don't expect it, but I am hoping you'll let me stay.
The Conductor: And why's that?
- Because I don't know where I'm going, but I feel like it's important I get there.
	The Conductor: I appreciate the sentiment, I really do, but without a ticket...
	[i] The child runs past again. [/i]
	The Conductor: You're lucky I need to handle this. I'll be back.
	=> END
- Because a strange man left this little girl with me, and I feel I need to keep her safe.
	The Conductor: I appreciate the sentiment, I really do, but without a ticket...
	[i] The little girl holds out a torn piece of paper. [/i]
	The Conductor: What's this?
	The Conductor: A ticket?
	The Conductor: Well, children don't need tickets. Where'd you get this?
	Little Girl: Someone stole it for me.
	The Conductor: Oh. Stole is, uh, interesting...
	[i] He turns back to you. [/i]
	The Conductor: But it looks like it's your lucky day. Here's your ticket.
	The Conductor: You can stay after all.
