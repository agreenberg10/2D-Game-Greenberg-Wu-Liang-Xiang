- Oh, uh, let me find it…
[i] You can’t find your ticket. [/i]
You: I can’t find it.
Conductor: Do you know where you’re going?
- No…
- Whatever way the train is going.
	[i] The Conductor looks annoyed. [/i]
Conductor: Do you know how you got on this train?
- Walking, probably.
	[i] The conductor doesn't seem to find you funny. [/i]
	Conductor: Listen, kid-
- No sir.
	Conductor: I see.
Conductor: So you don't know how you got here, or where you're going,
Conductor: And you don't have a ticket?
[i] A young child runs past. [/i]
Conductor: Ah, sh- I’ll be back. 
Conductor: You better find yourself a ticket, okay?
[i] He runs off after the child. [/i]
