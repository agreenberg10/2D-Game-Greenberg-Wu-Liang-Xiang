[i] The child that’s been running around stops for a moment. They hide behind a pole. [i]
- Give a small smile, but say nothing.
	[i] The child inches away from the pole to get a better look at you. [/i]
- Where are your parents? Let me call the conductor so we can look for them - 
	[i] The child darts away. [/i]
	=> END
- Hey kid, you okay?
	[i] The child adjusts their hood and hugs their toy cat closer. [/i] 
[i] The child stares at you with unblinking curiosity. [/i]
- What’s your name?
	[i] The child shakes their head and scowls. [/i]
- We'll be sitting here for a while. Feel free to join us.
	[i] The child’s eyes dart between you and the little girl. [/i]
	
	- My name is… I can’t… I don’t know…
		Little Girl: That's quite common here.
	- Stay quiet.
[i] The child relaxes their shoulders. [/i]

- Do you know where we’re headed?
[i] The child shakes their head no. [/i]
Charity: Do YOU know where we're headed?
- No...
	[i] The child sits down, stroking their cat plush.
	=> END
- Of course.
	Charity: I see...
	Charity: Are we headed somewhere good? Or somewhere bad?
	- Good, I think.
		Charity: That's what everyone thinks.
	- Bad, I think.
		Charity: How unfortunate...
	- I'm not sure yet.
		Charity: That's okay. Most people don't know...
		Charity: We can only convince ourselves one way or another.
[i] The child sits down. [/i]
