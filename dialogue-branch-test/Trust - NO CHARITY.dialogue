[i] The child that’s been running around stops for a moment. They hide behind a pole. [i]
- Give a small smile, but say nothing.
	[i] The child inches away from the pole to get a better look at you. [/i]
- Where are your parents? Let me call the conductor so we can look for them - 
	[i] The child darts away. [/i]
	=> END
- Hey kid, you okay?
	[i] The child darts away. [/i] 
	=> END
[i] The child stares at you with unblinking curiosity. [/i]
- What’s your name?
	[i] The child darts away. [/i]
	=> END
- I’ll be sitting here for a while. Feel free to join me.
	[i] The child’s eyes dart between you and the empty seat. [/i]
	- My name is… I can’t… I don’t know…
	- Stay quiet.
[i] The child relaxes their shoulders. [/i]

- Do you know where we’re headed?
[i] The child shakes their head no. [/i]
	
- That makes two of us.
[i] The child sits down. [/i]
